## Overview ##

We've added support for the Log4net appender. This allows you to leverage your current investment in log4net, but leverage the power and flexibility that comes with the ReflectInsight viewer. You can view your log4net messages in realtime, in a rich viewer that allows you to filter out and search for what really matters to you.

 The log4net extension supports Log4net v1.2.11.0. However if you need to support an older version, then you will need to download the ReflectInsight Logging Extensions Library from GitHub. You can then reference and rebuild the extension against a specific release of the log4net dll.

## Benefits of ReflectInsight Extensions ##

The benefits to using the Insight Extensions is that you can easily and quickly add them to your applicable with little effort and then use the ReflectInsight Viewer to view your logging in real-time, allowing you to filter, search, navigate and see the details of your logged messages.

## Getting Started
